You have just discovered our advanced monitoring tool for your Laravel applications and all the individual sites that you manage. We have designed it as a central dashboard to harmonise the maintenance of your entire website roster. Because we believe that coders should be out there coding. Let computers monitor computers, so that we humans don’t have to worry about it.

We searched the galaxy for a robust answer to our challenges, and found none. So, our team embarked on our greatest mission yet and 1Pilot was born.
