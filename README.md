<p><strong>[You]</strong> What are you, strange being?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Greetings, traveller. I am 1Pilot. I am a tool created to monitor and manage earthbound PrestaShop.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> OK... What is your primary purpose?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> I was created to reduce the time you spend managing applications, so that you can focus on your primary mission.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> Wait, what? How could you know... What is my primary mission?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> My records indicate that your primary mission is ...searching database... to code in your underwear, jamming to Radiohead.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> ðŸ˜²... ðŸ¤ª... Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Affirmative, traveller. â€˜Sweetâ€™.</p>
